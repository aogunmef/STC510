I wonder if he knew there wasn‚Äôt a human driving, as he hurried along. Using Waymo over the years has made me a better driver.  It even reminds me of things I learned over 20 years ago in a defensive driving course. I try to drive like the Waymo Driver; carefully and patiently. I hope my kids pick up on this too. There‚Äôs just so many ways we rationalize taking risks while driving especially when we are running late. Even I won‚Äôt use the Waymo service if I‚Äôm running late. In awe of the progress üëè. #TechThursday #AutonomousVehicles #Waymo"

10,"A reminder‚Äîin particular for the environmental consulting industry‚Äî that document formats change over time as technology changes.  Remember when airplane tickets were these weird-looking narrow forms on thick paper stock?  Or whenever you paid with a credit card, you'd hear that characteristic ""crunch"" sound as the merchant swiped a 3-part carbon-copy credit card receipt form over your card to get it's imprint?So too can report formats change with changing times, including environmental consulting report formats and documents.  I've sat through quite a few meetings with environmental consulting firms where they just could not grasp the concept of a table format change, or their logo not being on the bottom left of the form.  Change is inevitable.#changemanagement #environmentalconsulting "

19,"When you flip a switch, the light turns on, right? Not everywhere. The ability to instantly illuminate a room is often taken for granted in developed nations, yet many communities across the globe live without this important facility.Barefoot Products provides solar lighting products specifically for low-income populations in developing countries that have limited access to electricity. Their mission is to help these communities break their dependence on inefficient, expensive, and polluting light sources (often derived from diesel generated power or burning kerosene) by giving them an alternative sustainable and cost-effective solution.To better understand the end users, our design team travelled to Africa to learn about the issues faced by our client and those living ‚Äòoff the grid‚Äô. Surprising, we discovered that whilst some impoverished communities had limited lighting, they still had mobile phones and relied on these for communication, safety and payment transactions. For this reason, it was determined that in addition to providing a much-needed sustainable light source, it was also important to add a USB output to support device charging. This insight would not have been discovered had we not immerse our design team in the target community. We designed the next generation of solar lighting and power kits for Barefoot Power that were high-quality, reliable, and affordable. The final product incorporating solar panels, power inverters and rechargeable battery systems and charge monitoring systems. The final designs had a distinctive aesthetic and provided a new level of performance and usability.The solar lighting and power system received extremely positive feedback from the target community. For Ingenuity it has been a privilege to use our design skills to help support disadvantaged communities around the world.#productdesign #createbettertogether "
20,"Feeling like you owe too much tech debt? Don't worry, managing it is easier than it sounds. The first step is to recognize it for what it is: A necessary evil. Like financial debt, it can be leveraged to drive growth but too much of it can take you to a total ruin.Once you realize that you will actually be able to put it to good use for: 1. Quicker product development: Tech debt allows a product to be quickly developed and released to market, which can be advantageous if there is a time-sensitive demand.2. Cost savings: It can help reduce development costs in the short term, as it eliminates the need for costly refactoring or rebuilding.3. Focus on core features: Tech debt allows development teams to focus on the core features of the product, rather than spend time on less important features.But all this would go to waste if you don't actively manage it and plan for it: 1. Set limits: Define what is the optimum amount of tech debt that can be taken on.2. Prioritize: Prioritize tech debt items so the most important ones are addressed first and avoid stacking it up as it compounds quickly. 3. Measure and track: Understand the size of the problem and ensure it does not get too large. There has to be someone responsible for this monitoring and another team responsible for dealing with it. On time!4. Refactor regularly: Schedule regular periods for refactoring code to reduce the amount of tech debt. Take new deployment breaks and deal with your debt. 5. Leverage automation: This helps you manage your ongoing maintenance, such as automated code reviews and automated tests.Fail at the above and you have a guaranteed failure of all your #digitaltransformation initiatives. Beyond ruining your #IT you will also run your business to the ground. Real quick."
